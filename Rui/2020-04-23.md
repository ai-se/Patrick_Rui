### Done

1. Pre-process and run 6 security datasets without attacks

| Dataset                | Original ACC |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Drebin Android Malware | 99.45%       |
| NSL-KDD                | 78.57%       |
| CSE-CIC-IDS2018        | 98.88%       |
| CIC-IDS-2017           | 97.73%       |
| CICAndMal2017          | 94.74%       |
| Contagio PDF Malware   | 99.22%       |

2. Perform FGSM attack to exising datasets

| Dataset                | Original ACC | FGSM ACC |
|------------------------|--------------|----------|
| Drebin Android Malware | 99.45%       | 45.78%   |
| NSL-KDD                | 78.57%       | 30.19%   |
| CSE-CIC-IDS2018        | 98.88%       | 68.80%   |
| CIC-IDS-2017           | 97.73%       | 37.20%   |
| CICAndMal2017          | 94.74%       | 52.20%   |
| Contagio PDF Malware   | 99.22%       | 40.50%   |

Gradient is used to minimize loss function, FGSM attack is to add perturbation in oppsite direction of gradient to maximize loss function

FGSM is controled by a epsilon parameter, deciding the degree of perturbation

X_train = X_train + epsilon * perturbation
current epsilon used is 0.2


### Doing

1. Perform attacks to all 6 security datasets
2. preliminary idea with hyperparameter tuning
