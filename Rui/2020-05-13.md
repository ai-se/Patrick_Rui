### Gower Distance

[Gower Distance](https://www.thinkdatascience.com/post/2019-12-16-introducing-python-package-gower/) is a metric created in 1971, used to compute disntance between both numeric and categorial data, values in range [0,1]

#### In both figures, the best performance model is leftmost point, because the distance with itself is 0.
