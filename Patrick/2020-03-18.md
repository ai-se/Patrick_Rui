# Done
 - Dependency data acquisition (from student of Dr. Spinellis) (https://zenodo.org/record/3626750#.XnEYwKhKiUk) ~22GB 300+ modules (non-deprecated modules that support Debian Stretch)
 - Data re-labeling and partial re-formatting 33/321
 - Extented literature review for software quality and reliability (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DC3sv8YqNU8Dy3dbf8-fFURLWrM9_sZlLSUIOJ1hrKc/edit#gid=0)

# Doing
 - Re-producing dependency fault detection work (https://www.dimitro.gr/assets/papers/SMS20.pdf)
 - Data parsering and re-formatting for modules (Puppet manifests)
 - Adjusting ROME algorithm for new sematic-related task, add classifications

# To do
 - apply new methods on dependency fault predition
 - predict faults in Puppet manifests (ordering violation + notice missing), using a new benchmark to compare results
 - extend the work to ubuntu packages
 - try decomposed health issue task (monthly) estimation (quality/reliabality/popularity)
 - related data collection (quality/reliabality/popularity)

# Roadblocks
 - lack of knowledge of Puppet, ocaml, system call trace and sematic-related prediction
