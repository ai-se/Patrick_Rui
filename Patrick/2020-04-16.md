# Done
 - github repo data refined, following the suggestion from Dr. Daniel German's [EMSE](http://kblincoe.github.io/publications/2015_EMSE_GitHubPerils.pdf) paper: 
 - applied filters to avoid some previous issues: [filters](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QhuDYZkOX5HaAxmh7pSHf-eAZJo6-DAJ-pVj7FlrruI/edit#gid=0) + [code](https://github.com/ai-se/Patrick_Rui/blob/master/Patrick/repo_select.py)
 - created keyword pool to remove irrelevante repos: [pool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1g1Fh84bqrdEHV6CNqAGvYIe2QwzB30yo3y8MWeJsk/edit?usp=sharing)
 - obtained stronger repo list (1694 items) (avoiding "0" issue and irrelevancies, will be renamed "Xia_2020_monthly_data" or "Xia2020") [list](https://github.com/ai-se/Patrick_Rui/blob/master/Patrick/repo_list3.csv)
